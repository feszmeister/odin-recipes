# odin-recipes 

This is a project meant to demonstrate my ability to handle basic HTML tasks. To show proficiency I am creating a website with various recipes, consisting of links to these recipes aswell as various images to put the lessons into action. In this project I used unordered and ordered lists, complete with relevant links and images aswell as a return to homepage to view the other recipes.
