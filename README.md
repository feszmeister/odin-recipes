# odin-recipes 

This is a project meant to demonstrate my ability to handle basic HTML tasks. To show proficiency I am creating a website with a homepage that links to these recipes aswell as various images to put the lessons into action. In the project I used unordered and ordered lists, complete with relevant links and resized images aswell as using attributes to link back to the homepage. 
Filipino food is bomb ass dank ass food
