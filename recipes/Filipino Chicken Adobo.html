    <h3>What is Chicken Adobo?</h3>
        <p>Chicken Adobo is a classic dish in the cuisine of the Philippines, one that predates any external influence.
        This version is based on a more modern itration, using soy sauce to provide savory depth and rice vinegar for adobo's signature acidity.</p>
        <p>Browning the meat, while optional, improves the depth of flavor in both the chicken and the sauce, and you can take that even further by broiling the braised chicken after it's fully cooked.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4> 
        <ul>
         <li>1 Tbsp of desired oil </li>
         <li>4 bone in, skin on chicken legs, thighs and drumstick seperated</li>
         <li>8 cloves of garlic</li>

         <li>2-3 Fresh or dried bay leaves <em>Use slightly less if fresh</em></li>
         <li>1 1/2 Tsp of whole black peppercorns</li>
         <li>1 1/4 Cup (300ml) Water</li> 
         <li>1 Cup (240ml) soy sauce</li> 
         <li>1 Cup (240ml) rice vinegar</li>
         <li>Steamed white rice or fried rice if desired</li>
        </ul>   
    <h4>Steps</h4> 
        <ol>
         <li>Remove chicken from refrigeration, blot chicken dry and season with salt</li>
         <li>Heat desired oil over medium heat</li>
         <li>Add the chicken to the pot in a single layer, <em>skin side down</em>, and cook until browned</li>
         <li>After skin side is browned flip and cook for 3 minutes until <em>lightly browned</em>. Once done remove from pot and set aside the chicken for now.</li>
         <li>Add the garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the pot and cook until fragrant and garlic begins to take on a golden colour. ~Approx 30s~</li>
         <li>Now add water and stir, incorporating any peices that have stuck to the bottom of the pot. Then add soy sauce and vinegar.</li>
