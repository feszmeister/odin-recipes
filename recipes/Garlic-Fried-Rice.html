    <h3>What is Sinangag?</h3>
        <p>Sinangag, or garlic fried rice, is the ultimate Filipino breakfast side dish.
            Made with day-old rice fried in oil and garlic, it's the best aroma to wake up to in the morning. 
            The basic formula for fried rice is day-old white rice plus oil plus garlic. 
            But more often than not, Filipinos add more ingredients to flesh out the dish and make it even more flavorful. 
            Don't be surprised to find peas, carrots, corn, and bits of ham in your sinangag. 
            Sinangag is most often served with a fried egg and a traditional meat dish such as tocino, tapa, or longganisa.</p>
